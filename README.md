KindleTools
====

KindleTools is a web application for finding the PID (Personal Identifier) of older Amazon Kindle devices, which is based on the serial number. It does NOT provide any sort of functions related to the removal of DRM (Digital Rights Management) from eBooks. This webapp is written using the Ruby on Rails (RoR) platform.

This simple tool is maintained for existing functionality, but feature development is not active. If you'd like to take over the project, contact Preston Lee.
